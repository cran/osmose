#' OSMOSE: Modelling Marine Exploited Ecosystems
#' 
#' OSMOSE is a multispecies and Individual-based model (IBM) which 
#' focuses on fish species. This model assumes opportunistic predation based on 
#' spatial co-occurrence and size adequacy between a predator and its prey 
#' (size-based opportunistic predation). It represents fish individuals grouped 
#' into schools, which are characterized by their size, weight, age, taxonomy and 
#' geographical location (2D model), and which undergo major processes of fish 
#' life cycle (growth, explicit predation, natural and starvation mortalities, 
#' reproduction and migration) and a fishing mortality distinct for each species 
#' (Shin and Cury 2001, 2004). The model needs basic parameters that are often 
#' available for a wide range of species, and which can be found in FishBase 
#' for instance. This package provides tools to build a model and run simulations
#' using the OSMOSE model. See <http://www.osmose-model.org/> for more details.
