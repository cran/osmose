\title{OSMOSE: Modelling Marine Exploited Ecosystems}
\description{
OSMOSE is a multispecies and Individual-based model (IBM) which 
focuses on fish species. This model assumes opportunistic predation based on 
spatial co-occurrence and size adequacy between a predator and its prey 
(size-based opportunistic predation). It represents fish individuals grouped 
into schools, which are characterized by their size, weight, age, taxonomy and 
geographical location (2D model), and which undergo major processes of fish 
life cycle (growth, explicit predation, natural and starvation mortalities, 
reproduction and migration) and a fishing mortality distinct for each species 
(Shin and Cury 2001, 2004). The model needs basic parameters that are often 
available for a wide range of species, and which can be found in FishBase 
for instance. This package provides tools to build a model and run simulations
using the OSMOSE model. See <http://www.osmose-model.org/> for more details.
